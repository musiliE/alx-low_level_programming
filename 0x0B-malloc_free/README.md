# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

Aim of this proejct is to understand memory allocation in C programs.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are functions written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-create_array.c` | function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char |
| `1-strdup.c` | function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter |
| `2-str_concat.c` | function that concatenates two strings |
| `3-alloc_grid.c` | function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers |
| `4-free_grid.c` | function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function |
